Combining mulitple data sources to be able to run analytics based off of.

First we will take all of the combine data from year 2000 to current year and store it either in postgres database or in google bigquery

Next we will take in college data for these players and publish to postgres/ google bigquery

Then we will take NFL draft data and store it to show what round these players were selected

Then we will take NFL data and add it in to show if the players were successful in the NFL

If time allows I would like to explore gambling odds from before the NFL draft to see how well they predict where a player is drafted

The stretch goal would be to implement the weather api to join to the college game data to see how well players played in the snow/rain in college (if applicable)
